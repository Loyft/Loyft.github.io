<p>Sentiment analysis of 3.585 articles that were published on Spiegel Online between 5/5/21 and 6/5/21. Including Spiegel Plus and deleted articles.</p>

<h3 id="sentiment-per-category">Sentiment per Category</h3>

<p>I wrote an AI that assigned each word in every category a sentiment score between -1 and 1. The mean of all individual scores per word resulted in a score for each article. This article score is an indicator for the overall positivity/negativity of an article.</p>

<ul>
  <li>-1	very negative</li>
  <li>0	neutral</li>
  <li>1	very positive</li>
</ul>

<p>The following graphic shows the sum of sentiments per category. An article with 0.5 Sentiment, and another one with -0.5 Sentiment would even each other out to 0. An article with 0.2 and one with -0.4 would result in -0.2.</p>

<p><em>Panorama</em> and <em>Ausland</em> are the only categories with negative sentiment. <em>Sport</em> articles are very positive and all other categories are overall positive.
Interestingly</p>

<p>The graphic below displays the mean sentiment per category as a box plot. The least positive Article in <em>Tests</em> has a sentiment score of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.32</code>, which is still in the top 26% of the most positive rated articles.</p>
