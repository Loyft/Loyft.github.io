<h3 id="sentiment-per-category">Sentiment per Category</h3>

<p>I wrote an AI that assigned each word in every category a sentiment score between -1 and 1. The mean of all individual scores per word resulted in a score for each article. This article score is an indicator for the overall positivity/negativity of an article.</p>

<p>-1	very negative
  0	neutral
  1	very positive</p>

<p>The following graphic shows the sum of sentiments per category. An article with 0.5 Sentiment, and another one with -0.5 Sentiment would even each other out to 0. An article with 0.2 and one with -0.4 would result in -0.2.</p>
